## First planning:

* [x] Use and create the [issues] section to add backlogs.
* [x] View the [projects] section to control and manage the development
* [x] Try to plan this app in your mind
* [x] Create the [milestones] on github section
* [x] Create a code quality test for control
* [x] Continue the development and documentation, actions on [Dev] branch 

Good luck! <3



## Second planning:

### Recreate the [Provi]'s landing page on figma:
- [x] Recreate the Provi landing page on a draft in [Figma]
- [x] Comment the finished links on this [issue](https://github.com/savio591/provi-clone/issues/5)
- [x] With the Figma project finished, you will be able to describe and understand the components, structure, and actions. So, you can create the backlogs/issues based on your Figma elements, components, and pages.
- [x] Register your work times, use each pomodoro cycle as metrics.
- [x] Put your pomo cycles in a new article, called [STATS.md]

## Third planning:

* [ ] List the components and pages and create the backlogs on [issues] page
* [ ] All the new plans will be described on [issues] page.

### Coding:

* [x] Routes: Create "Home Page" #12
  * [x] Create the routes with react-dom and replace the hello world test
  * [x] Create the home page on '/pages/home' and put it on the default path route as an exact component.
  * [x] Put a "Hello world!" on this page and test.
